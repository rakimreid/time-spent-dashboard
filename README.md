# Background

Per our World in Data: " Time is the ultimate limited resource. Every single one of us has exactly the same “time budget”: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year – 8,760 hours every year of our lives.

How do we actually spend our time? There are many commonalities across the world: we all sleep, work, eat, and enjoy leisure time. But there are also important differences in the freedom people have to spend time on the things they value most. Studying how people across the world spend their time provides an important perspective for understanding living conditions, economic opportunities, and general well-being."

# Data Source

The data source comes from a CSV file on Makeover Monday's data.world page:

# The Data

This dashboard focuses on a a single problem: With whom do we spend our time? Alone? With friends? Or with coworkers? 

This information was plotted with the respondents' age to see trends.

# Evaluation 

Time spent with coworkers and friends diverges at age 19 until around age 67. It appears people replace time with their friends with time with coworkers. In short, coworkers become people's new friends.
